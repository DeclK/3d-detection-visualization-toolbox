You need to`pip install vedo` to run this projects. For more details, please refere to  [3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer](https://github.com/hailanyi/3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer).

Main function is in vis.py. Most of the funcionalities are commented, and some were written in Chinese, but overall it's easy to read.

I've made some demo videos to show the results:
